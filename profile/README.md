### Welcome to Learn Blockchain Development With Chris ðŸ‘‹

This repo was started so that I could show my friends how to do blockchain development. They wanted to learn how to launch their own NFT project and this will be the first series that we code through together. We meet every Saturday to hack together before grabbing food. Anyone who is interested can join us!  ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Take a look at [https://hackwithchris.github.io/](https://hackwithchris.github.io/) for more information.
